# EVM - The Basics

Challenge Author: NoobMaster

Description: I have some EVM runtime bytecode, whatever that means. You need to
find the value, in hex, that you need to send to make the contract STOP and not
self destruct. Wrap the hex in `n00bz{}`. If the correct answer is 9999, the flag
is `n00bz{0x270f}`.

# Solution

This approach comes from not actually knowing anything about EVM or blockchain.
As such, I basically treated this as a reverse engineering challenge. 

The use of the word "bytecode" and the search results on Google for "EVM 
runtime bytecode" made me decide to look for a decompiler to put the hex value 
into.

Here's the one I used [Dedaub decompiler](https://app.dedaub.com/decompile).

The assembly-like representation of this code is:

```assembly
    0x0: PUSH0     
    0x1: CALLVALUE 
    0x2: PUSH2 0x1337
    0x5: MUL       
    0x6: PUSH6 0xfdc29ff358a3
    0xd: EQ        
    0xe: PUSH1 0x12
   0x10: JUMPI     
   0x11: SELFDESTRUCT
   0x12: STOP      
``` 

Each line contains an address for the instruction, followed by an opcode
and, optionally an argument (really only for the PUSH opcodes).

This language revolves around a stack, so most opcodes use the top items
on the stack as their arguments.

I also found, with a little bit of searching, [the official Ethereum yellow
paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf), with a formal 
outline of each opcode (See Appendix H.2, about page 33). This, and a little help from
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44602539/how-does-the-opcode-jump-work-in-the-evm-stack)
and ChatGPT, allowed me to easily understand each opcode, despite ChatGPT
blatantly deceiving me a few times.

The relevant opcodes are:
- PUSH0: Push 0 onto the stack
- PUSH*n*: Push the following *n* bytes onto the stack
- CALLVALUE: basically an input function as far as we are concerned
- MUL: Multiply the top two stack values
- EQ: Check if the top two stack values are equal. If so, replace them with a 1,
  otherwise replace them with a 0.
- JUMPI: Pop the top two stack values. If the second value is non-zero, jump to
  the first value. Otherwise, proceed to the next instruction

The challenge tells us that we want to reach the STOP opcode without going
through the SELFDESTRUCT opcode. This means that we need to make the EQ opcode
return 1, so that the JUMPI opcode *will* jump to the STOP opcode.
<br />
Let's follow the stack values through the code (the top of the stack is shown to the right):

```python
    0x0: PUSH0 # push a 0 onto the stack
        [ 0 ]
    0x1: CALLVALUE # input into the transaction, i.e. the value we are trying to solve for
        [ 0, input ]
    0x2: PUSH2 0x1337 # push 0x1337 onto the stack
        [ 0, input, 0x1337 ]
    0x5: MUL # pop the two top values off the stack, multiply them, and push the result on
        [ 0, input * 0x1337 ]
    0x6: PUSH6 0xfdc29ff358a3 # push 0xfdc29ff358a3 onto the stack
        [ 0, input * 0x1337, 0xfdc29ff358a3 ]
    0xd: EQ # pop the two top values off the stack, check if they are equal, and push the result on
        [ 0, input * 0x1337 == 0xfdc29ff358a3 ]
    0xe: PUSH1 0x12 # push 0x12 onto the stack
        [ 0, input * 0x1337 == 0xfdc29ff358a3, 0x12 ]
   0x10: JUMPI  # pop the last value off the stack, using it as an instruction pointer. Jump to it
        [ 0 ]   # if the next value popped off is a 1
   0x11: SELFDESTRUCT
   0x12: STOP      
``` 

By labelling the stack like this, we can see that the STOP opcode will only be
jumped to if the value of `input` is such that `input * 0x1337 == 0xfdc29ff358a3`.

This is simple enough to solve (use python instead of searching for hex calculators):

```python
>>> print(hex(0xfdc29ff358a3 // 0x1337))
0xd34db33f5
```

Now, we just wrap it in the flag format:

<summary>Flag</summary>

`n00bz{0xd34db33f5}`
