I independently designed and tuned a computer vision algorithm using OpenCV to detect the location of a landmark object, affecting the autonomous path chosen by the robot. In addition, I worked with other programmers to tune the PID control system used by the drivetrain for accurate autonomous movement. I also delivered lessons on PID using the Road Runner library and about the basics of the FTC SDK.",
